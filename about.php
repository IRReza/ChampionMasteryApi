			<h2>About this Website</h2>
			<p>	This website was created for the Riot Api Challenge, April 2016 on Champion Mastery data.  
				Gaming is all about fun, luck and having a good strategy, so we decided to combine them into one website. We hope it will be  a fun experience for everyone that wishes to learn more about League of Legends, themselves and their friends.

			<h3> 1. Champions </h3>
			<p>The champions tab contains your top champions sorted by mastery levels. This is a great way to see your friend's favorite champions or decide which champion to play next. For example, if you want to earn a chest you should pick a champion that has a silver chest icon since those are the champions that have not earned you a chest this season.
			</p>

		<div class="cont_box1">
			
			<div class="box_left2">
			<h3> 2. Role </h3>
			<p>This tab contains the most popular roles you and your friends like to play. Is your friend insisting you play as support? No problem, just show him your were made to play as an Assassin! </p></div>
			
		</div>
		<div class="cont_box1">
			
			<div class="box_left2">
			<h3> 3. Summary </h3>
			<p> If you're like me, you might like Aram more than Classic. Maybe you find out your friend is a big Aram fan just like you. Next time, you can team up.  </p></div>

		<div class="cont_box1">
			
			<div class="box_left2">
			
			<h3> 4. Ranked </h3>

			<p>This is where the magic begins. We added class filters to the champion list, just click one of the seven buttons( All, Support, Assassin. Tank, Fighter, Mage, Marksman) and enjoy the show.
			Each champion panel contains basic information aswell as skills, skill description and skins. 
			
			Hint: You can click on skill icons and skins, try it and you might have a pleasant surprise. :D</p>

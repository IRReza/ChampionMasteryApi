			<h2>About this Website</h2>
			<p>	This website was created for the Riot Api Challenge, April 2016 on Champion Mastery data. Gaming is all about fun, luck and 
			having a good strategy, so we decided to combine them into one website. 
			</br>We hope it will be a fun experience for everyone that wishes 
			to learn more about League of Legends, themselves and their friends. As far as luck goes, we went on and got council from Lady Luck 
			herself upon choosing the category, and as summoners (imnubcake and psycho), we were happy that faith has given us the opportunity to
			work on our creativity/originality skills, and in our arsenal of spells and code creating magic, we used PHP/HTML/JQuery to bring chaos,
			light and awe to the eyes and minds of any who dare enter our website, engulfing them better in the world of League of Legends.

		<p style="width:94%;">The first step is selecting the realm(server) you are part of, and inscribing(typing) in your summoner name. You can view your total champion mastery score in the panel below and being a powerful summoner, you can summon 4 other friends to view their scores as well. </p>

		Tabs: Champions, Role, Summary and Ranked

			<h3> 1. Champions </h3>
			<p>The champions tab contains your top champions sorted by mastery levels. This is a great way to see your friend's favorite champions or decide which champion to play next. For example, if you want to earn a chest you should pick a champion that has a silver chest icon since those are the champions that have not earned you a chest this season.
			</p>

		<div class="cont_box1">
			
			<div class="box_left2">
			<h3> 2. Role </h3>
			<p>This tab reveals the most popular roles you and your companions like to partake. One of companions tries to persuade you into being a support? Destroy his dreams by showing him that you were an assassin in disguise all along. </p></div>
			
		</div>
		<div class="cont_box1">
			
			<div class="box_left2">
			<h3> 3. Summary </h3>
			<p> If you're like me, you might like Aram more than Classic. Maybe you find out your friend is a big Aram fan just like you. Next time, you can team up.  </p></div>

		<div class="cont_box1">
			
			<div class="box_left2">
			
			<h3> 4. Ranked </h3>
			<p> Tired of the same all normal battles where you are not rated for your skills on the battlefield? Try the ranked matches, and you can find everything you need about them in the ranked tab. </p></div>

			<p>This is where the magic begins. We added class filters to the champion list, just click one of the seven buttons( All, Support, Assassin. Tank, Fighter, Mage, Marksman) and enjoy the show.
			Each champion panel contains basic information aswell as skills, skill description and skins. 
			
			</br></br><span>Hint 1:</span> You can click on skill icons and skins, try it and you might have a pleasant surprise. :D</p>
			<span>Hint 2:</span> The champion information panel is also accessible directly from the the champions tab.</p>
